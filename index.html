                <b>About This Test</b> — Genalyte’s SARS-CoV-2 Serology Panel detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2
                antigens (the virus that causes COVID-19). Antibodies are proteins made by your body to attack foreign
                substances, like viruses or bacteria. The process of developing antibodies is termed an immune response.
                If you have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, your body may manufacture antibodies to the virus. This test is
                designed to detect the overall presence (positive) or absence (negative) of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted text-8">
                <b>About This Test</b> — Genalyte has accredited and certified laboratories based in San Diego,
                California and Austin, Texas. Our tests go through rigorous validation efforts to ensure clinical
                effectiveness. Unlike other SARS-CoV-2 tests on the market, the Genalyte SARS-CoV-2 serology panel has a
                very low false-positive rate and has an accuracy rate exceeding 99%.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted text-8">
                <b>Disclaimer</b> — Positive and negative calls for overall SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and individually for
                IgG and IgM, are generated by a validated machine learning algorithm and may not reflect individual
                antigen reactivity. This test has not been reviewed by the FDA. Negative results do not rule out
                SARS-CoV-2 infection, particulary in those who have been in contact with the virus. Follow-up testing
                with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals. Results
                from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection
                or to inform infection status. Positive results may be due to past or present infection with
                non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL, OC43, or 229E.
